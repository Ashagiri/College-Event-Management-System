# College-Event-Management-System
# 📌 Introduction
The College Event Management System is a robust web application built using the Django framework, designed to streamline the organization and registration process for campus events.

In many colleges, event registration is often unmanaged, leading to overcrowded venues and a poor experience for attendees. This project specifically addresses that "mess" by implementing a Dynamic Capacity Control system. By linking registrations directly to available seats, the system ensures that every event remains organized, safe, and professional.

# 🚀 Key Features
Real-time Capacity Tracking: Automatically calculates "Filled vs. Available" seats to prevent over-booking.

Secure Authentication: Separate portals for Students and Administrators using Django's built-in security.

Event Discovery: A searchable dashboard that allows students to find upcoming fests, workshops, and competitions.

MVT Architecture: Built using a clean Model-View-Template structure for high performance and scalability.

Admin Dashboard: A centralized interface for college staff to manage event details and monitor student participation.
