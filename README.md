# College-Event-Management-System
# 📌 Introduction
The College Event Management System is a robust web application built using the Django framework, designed to streamline the organization and registration process for campus events.

In many colleges, event registration is often unmanaged, leading to overcrowded venues and a poor experience for attendees. This project specifically addresses that "mess" by implementing a Dynamic Capacity Control system. By linking registrations directly to available seats, the system ensures that every event remains organized, safe, and professional.
